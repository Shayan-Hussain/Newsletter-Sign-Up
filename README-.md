## Overview

This is a Frontend mentor project. I made this just to practice the basics fully. I had to make a newsletter signup page that takes in the email and display's a success message. I added one extra feature of local storage; whereby I stored the email in an array and stored that array into local storage. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

The files provided by Frontend mentor were kinda confusing, so I created a sperate local repository and then added the builtin files along the way as I needed.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that padding and margin are not included in the total height or width unless the element's box-sizing is border-box.

I also used my custom utility classes so that I am clear about the basic functions of the CSS.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

This is the absolute basic it can get for a frontend project. And thats why I have added local storage functionality. I still have to make it responsive and need to add the email validation. I am looking for correct method to do so that is used frequently accross most webapps.

### Useful resources
